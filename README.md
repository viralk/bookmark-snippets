# bookmark-snippets
A small collection of snippet to use as browser bookmarks

## How to use
In order to use the functions, just copy the desired snippet and paste it as a URL to a browser bookmark. While you visit a page, click on the bookmark containing the snippet and the function will be activated. To remove the function simply reload the page.

In the index.js file you can find the following functions at the moment:
- Highlight all elements in the page
- Highlight all links in the page
- Remove all iframes in the page
- Check all checkbox in the page

New functions will be added soon...
