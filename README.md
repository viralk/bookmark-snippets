# bookmark-snippets
A small collection of snippet to use as browser bookmarks

## Getting started
In order to use the functions, just copy the desired snippet and paste it as a URL to a browser bookmark. While you visit a page, click on the bookmark containing the snippet and the function will be activated. To remove the function simply reload the page.

In the index.js file you can find the following functions at the moment:
- Highlight all elements in the page
- Highlight all links in the page
- Remove all iframes in the page
- Check all checkbox in the page

New functions will be added soon...

### Why use the snippets?
boolmark-snippets is a simple and minimalist collection of useful snippets designed to facilitate the daily work of the web developer. You may ask why not simply use browser extensions and the reasons are that extensions many times offer too much more than necessary, as well as having to install different extensions for each function

Snippets as bookmarks are easy to setup, use and modify as needed.

### How can I contribute?
the snippets currently present are those I use every day. Whenever I have a need I will add any snippet created to the list. If you have any snippets you use or plan to propose more efficient snippets than those present just do a pull request
